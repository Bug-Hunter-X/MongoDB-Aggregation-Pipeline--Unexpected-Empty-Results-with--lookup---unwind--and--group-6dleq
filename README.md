# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline with the `$lookup`, `$unwind`, and `$group` operators. The pipeline unexpectedly returns empty results, even when there's matching data in the involved collections.

## Problem Description

The goal is to join two collections (`collectionA` and `collectionB`), unwind the results of the join, and then group the documents based on the original `_id` from `collectionA`. However, the pipeline consistently yields an empty array.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Ensure you have MongoDB set up and running.
2.  Create two collections, `collectionA` and `collectionB`, populated with relevant data with `foreignKey` referencing `_id` from `collectionA`.
3.  Run the provided JavaScript code containing the aggregation pipeline.
4.  Observe that the pipeline returns an empty array instead of the expected grouped results. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the data in collectionA and collectionB to ensure that the _id and foreignKey fields are correctly populated and have matching data types. Further investigation may be needed into the structure of the data to identify any discrepancies. It also involves double-checking the correctness of the aggregation pipeline stages, particularly the `$group` stage, to ensure data is processed correctly.   The `$push` operator in the `$group` stage should be used to ensure that the documents are correctly added to the array. The solution file provides a working example.
